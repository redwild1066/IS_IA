A simple antivirus coded in python capable of scanning selected files and deleting files that it detects as infected. This antivirus uses a large list of MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 malware hashes to determine infections. However as this project progresses I would like to implement machine learning detection with the long term goal of becoming a fully functioning antivirus.

Thank You! :)
